;;; Examples of s-expression syntax for XSLT templates.

;;; (Only <template> itself and its instructions so far.
;;; Not sure yet about <stylesheet> and its top level elements.)

;;; I'm using symbols in the XSL package here instead of keywords (but that
;;; doesn't really matter).
;;;
;;; There are currently no xsl:if/xsl:choose with XSLT semantics, only
;;; the lisp-style forms if, when, unless, cond.  We could add the xsl:
;;; forms if users want them, since XSL doesn't import CL anymore.

;;; The tricky part are forms with multiple different kinds of optional
;;; stuff, like xsl:template which has both normal attributes, AND
;;; parameters AND a body.  Or xsl:apply-templates with normal attributes AND
;;; parameters AND sorting rules.  I think body and parameters should
;;; have a syntax and is particularly easy to use, whereas sorting rules
;;; are probably less common.

;;; FIXME: How can we distinguish between:
;;;    (i) a pre-parsed XPath expression
;;;   (ii) an XPath string (for example, in <xsl:variable select="foo"/>)
;;;  (iii) an XSLT fragment (for example, in <xsl:variable>foo</xsl:variable>)
;;; which all end up in the same position of (let ((name OOPS)) ...)
;;;
;;; Right now, we require (iii) to be written as (progn ...) while
;;; (ii) is written literally.
;;;
;;; Alternatively, we could write (ii) as (:xpath ...) and (iii) literally.
;;;
;;; The problem with (i) and (ii) is whether "foo" is an XPath string
;;; (the node test for "foo") or a literal string in a sexp, meaning "'foo'".
;;; Currently we simply don't support (i), which is sad.
